# Pig-Game
2 player game


INSTRUCTIONS:
Player 1 starts with rolling a dice.
Once he rolls a dice, he can either press hold and keep the score displayed on dice (ex: 5), or keep rolling and get more value from rolling.
If player 1 decides to hold the score, it's player 2's turn to roll the dice.

There're are only 2 ways except holding the score to move on to the second player.
1) If you roll 1
2) If you roll 6 twice in a row.

You can set winning score as much as you want, if you leave it unfilled, winning score is 15.

HAVE FUN!!!
